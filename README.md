# DiscordNitroGenerator

Nitro generator with sending nitros in your discord channel using webhooks.

## About the Project
I wrote this project 1.5 years ago just for fun, but I guess for somebody this project will be a good impact.
Here I wrote a super useless authentication method: while you start the program, you must enter the authentication code from a .txt file which is created in your directory.

### Built With

The project utilizes the following libraries:
- **Windows.h**: For Windows API functions.
- **string**: For string manipulation.
- **iostream**: For input and output operations.
- **cURL**: For pull requests to the webhook.

## Getting Started

You just need to create a webhook in the Discord channel, and input the webhook to the program.
